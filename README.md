Transportation requires efficient route planning as well as optimising the route to reduce emissions and save fuel costs.  We propose a solution that  solves these problems by using TomTom API to get traffic data, Leaflet.js to make an interactive map and utilising google maps and WeatherStack API,  to provide accurate, real-time information to the user in a simple intuitive 
user friendly design.
By getting the data from these sources we train an ML model to predict the most efficient route which also takes into account the emissions of the vehicle based on vehicle data of the user.

this github repository contains the working files to create said solution to routing.
